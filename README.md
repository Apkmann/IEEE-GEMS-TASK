# I tried to deploy this site but the cors error occur while deploying in firebase host

Access to fetch at 'https://ypapi.formz.in/api/public/videos' from origin 'https://ieee-frontend-task.web.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'https://yp.formz.in' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Have the server send the header with a valid value, or, if an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
videos.js:18 GET https://ypapi.formz.in/api/public/videos net::ERR_FAILED
